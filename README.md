# Sales-Dashboard-TABLEAU

I developed an interactive Sales Dashboard using Tableau, aimed at delivering clear and actionable insights for business decision-making.
Key Features:
 • Comprehensive visualization of sales performance across regions and product categories.
 • Time-series analysis of revenue trends.
 • Identification of top-performing sales representatives.
 • Year-over-year comparison for strategic evaluation.
 • Dynamic filters enabling user-driven exploration of data.
This dashboard enhances visibility into key sales metrics, supports data-driven decisions, and enables stakeholders to monitor performance effectively.
